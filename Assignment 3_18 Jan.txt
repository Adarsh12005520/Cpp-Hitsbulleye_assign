Qns 1)

Write a program to print the area and perimeter of a triangle having sides of 3, 4 and 5 units by creating a class named 'Triangle' with the constructor having the three sides as its parameters.


Solution

#include<iostream>
#include<math.h>

using namespace std;

class Triangle
{
	public:
	void area(int a,int b,int c);
	void perimeter(int a,int b,int c);
};

void Triangle::area(int a,int b,int c)
{
	float s=((a+b+c)/2.0),A=sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c));
	cout<<"Area of a triangle is: "<<A<<" sq. units\n";
}

void Triangle::perimeter(int a,int b,int c)
{
	cout<<"Perimeter of a triangle is: "<<a+b+c<<" units\n";
}

int main()
{
	Triangle tr1;
	int side1=3,side2=4,side3=5;
	tr1.area(side1,side2,side3);
	tr1.perimeter(side1,side2,side3);
	return 0;
}








Qns 2)
Write a program to print the area of two rectangles having sides (4,5) and (5,8) respectively by creating a class named 'Rectangle' with a function named 'Area' which returns the area. Length and breadth are passed as parameters to its constructor.


Solution

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Rectangle
{
    
    private:
        int length;
        int breadth;
    public:
       
        Rectangle(int length, int breadth)
        {
            
            this->length = length;
            this->breadth = breadth;
        }
        
        int Area()
        {
            // calculating and returning Area
            return length * breadth;
        }
};

int main()
{
    
    Rectangle rectangle1(4,5); 
   
    Rectangle rectangle2(5,8); 

    cout<<"\nArea of first rectangle  :"<<rectangle1.Area();
     
    cout<<"\nArea of second rectangle :"<<rectangle2.Area();
    return 0;
}






Qns 3)
Write a program to print the area of a rectangle by creating a class named 'Area' taking the values of its length and breadth as parameters of its constructor and having a function named 'returnArea' which returns the area of the rectangle. Length and breadth of the rectangle are entered through keyboard.


Solution

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class Area{
	public:
		int len,width;
		void getArea(){
			cout<<"Enter the length: ";
			cin>>len;
			cout<<"Enter width: ";
			cin>>width;
		}
		void returnArea(){
			cout<<"Area is: "<<len*width;
		}
};
int main(){
	Area A;
	A.getArea();
	A.returnArea();
}


Qns 4)
Print the average of three numbers entered by the user by creating a class named 'Average' having a function to calculate and print the average without creating any object of the Average class.

Solution

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Average{
    public:
    static float calculateAverage(float a, float b, float c){
        return (a + b + c) / 3;
    }
};


int main(){
    cout<<"Enter three numbers: ";
    float a, b, c;
    cin>>a;
    cin>>b;
    cin>>c;
    cout<<"The average is: "<<Average::calculateAverage(a,b,c)<<endl;
    return 0;
}
